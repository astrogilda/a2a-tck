"""Reference runner (Python / rfc8785), and the harness for any Python implementation.

The corpus tests two functions, and MANIFEST.json names them under ``targets``:

* ``rfc8785``, an RFC 8785 primitive that turns one JSON value into canonical
  bytes. The RFC 8785 vectors apply to it, 53 of the 57.
* ``card-signing-input``, the bytes an Agent Card signature covers: the card
  without its top-level ``signatures`` field, canonicalized. Every vector
  applies to it, the four rule-3 vectors included.

With no options this runs both targets against the reference implementation,
rfc8785 on PyPI. To test another implementation, point the runner at it rather
than editing this file, so the record comes from an unmodified runner at a
known commit::

    python3 run_python.py --canonicalize mypkg.jcs:canonicalize
    python3 run_python.py --signing-bytes mypkg.card:signing_bytes --refusal mypkg.jcs:JCSError

A target whose function is not given is reported under ``targetsNotRun``, never
run through the reference, because a signing path assembled here from someone
else's primitive would test this runner's rule-3 handling rather than theirs.

Every vector gets one outcome. ``pass`` is the only passing one. On a MUST-ACCEPT
vector, ``diverged`` means the implementation returned bytes other than the
expected ones, which is the failure that breaks signatures between
implementations without raising anything, and ``refused`` means it raised one of
its declared refusal exceptions. On a MUST-REJECT vector, ``accepted`` means it
returned bytes for input that has none. ``errored`` means it raised something
that is not a declared refusal, so a crash is never read as a refusal.

Exit status: 0 when at least one target ran and every vector in it passed, 1 when
any vector failed, 2 when the corpus or an option could not be used.
