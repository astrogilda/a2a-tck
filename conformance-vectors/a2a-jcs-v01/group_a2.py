"""A2 -- signatures field exclusion.

a2a spec section 8.4.1 rule 3. Reading
a2a-python's own public source confirms the rule: `card_dict.pop(
'signatures', None)` runs BEFORE canonicalization, because a signature
cannot cover the field that carries itself -- the same self-reference RFC
8785 has no opinion on, since RFC 8785 knows nothing about a2a's
`signatures` field at all. 4 vectors, 2 MUST-REJECT.

This is the one Layer-A group that is NOT pure RFC 8785: RFC 8785 has no
concept of "exclude this key". So the verification shape differs from
A3/A4/A5/A6, and deliberately so -- forcing it through the RFC-8785-only
oracle harness would test the wrong thing:

  MUST-ACCEPT vectors test the PRODUCTION direction: given a full object
  that carries a `signatures` field, the canonical output is the RFC 8785
  canonicalization of the SAME object with `signatures` removed first.
  Both real oracles still compute the actual expected bytes (on the
  post-exclusion object) -- nothing here is hand-derived.

  MUST-REJECT vectors test the CONSUMPTION direction: a byte string
  presented AS the canonical form that still contains a `signatures` key
  violates the exclusion invariant and a conformant verifier must refuse
  it. A runner checks this by recomputing the card's signing bytes with the
  implementation under test and refusing when they differ from the
  presented bytes; an implementation that keeps `signatures` recomputes the
  presented bytes exactly and fails the vector. It is not an
  RFC-8785-well-formedness check, which is why it does not go through
  make_reject's oracle-refusal path -- both oracles would happily
  canonicalize a JSON object that happens to have a `signatures` key,
  because RFC 8785 does not forbid it. a2a's OWN rule does.
