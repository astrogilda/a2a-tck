"""Agent Card canonicalization conformance tests driven by the a2a-jcs-v01 corpus.

Requirements tested:
    CARD-SIGN-001, CARD-SIGN-002

Specification Section 8.4.1 states two rules that are pure functions of the
Agent Card content, so both are decidable from a vector corpus without a
running server:

* rule 2, canonicalize the card per RFC 8785 -- CARD-SIGN-001, exercised by
  the A3, A4, A5 and A6 groups;
* rule 3, exclude the ``signatures`` field from the signed content --
  CARD-SIGN-002, exercised by the A2 group.

Each vector carries a disposition.  MUST-ACCEPT vectors pin the exact canonical
bytes; MUST-REJECT vectors pin input a conformant canonicalizer has to refuse.
The expected bytes were not written by hand -- every one is the agreed output
of two independent RFC 8785 implementations, so this module measures the TCK's
canonicalizer against outside work rather than against itself.

A MUST-REJECT vector also asserts *where* the refusal happened.  Malformed
input that never reaches the canonicalizer would let a canonicalizer that
refuses nothing at all pass the whole reject half of the corpus.
